## About ##
The Little MongoDB Book is a free book introducing MongoDB.

The book was written shortly after the creation of the [MongoDB interactive tutorial](http://mongly.com). As such, the two can be seen as complementary.

The book was written by [Karl Seguin](http://openmymind.net), with [Perry Neal](http://twitter.com/perryneal)'s assistance.

## Formats ##
The book is written in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and converted to PDF using [PanDoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). A few LaTex specific commands have been placed in the markdown file to help with pdf-generation (namely for the title page and to create page breaks between chapters).

The LaTex template makes use of [Lena Herrmann's JavaScript highlighter](http://lenaherrmann.net/2010/05/20/javascript-syntax-highlighting-in-the-latex-listings-package).

Kindle and ePub format provided using [PanDoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). Run make en/mongodb.mobi to generate.
